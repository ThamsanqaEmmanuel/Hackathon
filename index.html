            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>Project I managed to do and complete was a Time and Attendace System. The project was aim for High school learners to keep track of whether they attend or decide not to but parents know that the child is at school. 
                The system would then keep record at the end of each month parents recieve a report of time and attendace of their child.<br><br>
                Second Project I am currently working on. It is a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).
                This socio-economic policy was implemented by the South African government in 1994 to address social problems and inequalities, particularly for previously disadvantaged communities. 
                Aim of the project is to enable South Africans to apply for an RDP without standing in long queues and also be able to track the status of their application.

            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <p>
                My journey began with a deep fascination for technology, leading me to a career as a software engineer. I thrived on the problem-solving aspects of coding.<br>
                I went on and did my degree and graduated with a bachelor of science in Information Tecnology and I specialized in software development. However upon getting my
                first job I got hired in networking field and I have been working as a technician for sometime which meant less time coding. Because
                of my undying passion for programming I found myself regaining my skill and learning more programming languages and skill with PLP academy.
